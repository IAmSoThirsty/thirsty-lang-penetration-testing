# Thirsty-lang Penetration Testing 💧🔒

Security testing framework with vulnerability scanners, network testing, and exploit detection.

## Features

- Vulnerability scanning
- Port scanning
- SQL injection testing
- XSS detection
- Network sniffing
- Exploit database
- Reporting tools

## Vulnerability Scanner

```thirsty
glass VulnerabilityScanner {
  glass async scanTarget(url) {
    shield scanProtection {
      sanitize url
      
      drink results = []
      
      cascade {
        fountain test in securityTests {
          drink result = await detect test {
            target: url,
            severity: "high"
          }
          
          thirsty result.vulnerable == parched
            results.push(result)
        }
      }
      
      return generateReport(results)
    }
  }
}
```

## SQL Injection Tester

```thirsty
glass SQLInjectionTester {
  drink payloads = [
    "' OR '1'='1",
    "1' UNION SELECT NULL--",
    "admin'--"
  ]
  
  glass async test(endpoint) {
    refill drink payload in payloads {
      cascade {
        drink response = await httpPost(endpoint, payload)
        
        detect response {
          pattern: /SQL syntax|mysql_fetch/i
          action: glass() {
            report("SQL Injection vulnerability found")
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
